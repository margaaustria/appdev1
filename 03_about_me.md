## Why I Want to Learn Git & GitHub

I want to learn Git and GitHub because it's important to my course right now and help me to compile and navigate all my recent projects.  Git is fast and efficiently tools for my projects. I can used it to handle and compile my simple or large projects, while GitHub help me to view others projects and work with my other peers. Learning Git and Github is big help for me to ready my portfolio and help me to learn more about with others collaborators.
